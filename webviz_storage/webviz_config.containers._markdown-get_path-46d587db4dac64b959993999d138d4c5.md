## Visualizing Fast Model Update (FMU) results with Webviz

Fast model update is an Equinor developed system that radically changes how reservoirs are modelled and developed.

By systematising big data and utilizing ensemble-based methods reservoir models are built and maintained
in a fraction of the time compared to the traditional methods.

A key success factor of FMU is the ability to extract value from enormous amount of data, as well as making it accessible.

Here are some examples on how Webviz makes FMU results more accessible.
