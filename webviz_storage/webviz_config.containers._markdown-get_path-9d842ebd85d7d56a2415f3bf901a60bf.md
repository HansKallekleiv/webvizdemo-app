### Layered map viewer
Below is a work in progress map viewer that uses [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com) in combination with hillshading to visualize subsurface maps. 

Additional layers for e.g. fault polygons and well data can be added.

This is a customized visualization that can be used to build different webviz containers to visualize subsurface
data in a map view.

### Uncertainty in seismic framework

Below is a work in progress dashboard to explore uncertainty in the velocity model and seismic interpretations.

An ensemble of surfaces (realizations) have been modelled stochastically and are displayed in a well-cross section on top of a seismic backdrop.

Seismic surveys, wells and surfaces are loaded on demand from e.g. /scratch results.
